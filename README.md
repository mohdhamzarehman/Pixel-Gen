# PixelGen - Image Generation using GAN

## Overview
PixelGen is a project focused on generating CIFAR-10-like images using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). This project aims to train a custom GAN model, which consists of a Generator and a Discriminator, to produce realistic images and differentiate between real and generated ones. The model is trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, a collection of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.

## Problem Statement
In various fields such as data science, machine learning, and digital art, there is a need for large, diverse datasets to train models effectively. However, obtaining and curating such datasets can be expensive and time-consuming. Moreover, the availability of unique and creative image variations is often limited.

## Solution
PixelGen tackles these challenges by leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create synthetic images that closely resemble the ones found in the CIFAR-10 dataset. This approach not only enriches current datasets with a wider range of images but also facilitates the exploration of innovative ideas and artistic interpretations. Our initiative provides support for both training models and generating images using Jupyter Notebooks or Google Colab, ensuring accessibility and user-friendliness.

## Idea Description
PixelGen leverages the power of GANs to create synthetic images that closely resemble those in the CIFAR-10 dataset. The innovation lies in the ability to generate high-quality images with unique variations, providing an endless supply of data for various applications. The use of Jupyter Notebooks and Google Colab for training and generation further enhances the accessibility and ease of use of the project.
